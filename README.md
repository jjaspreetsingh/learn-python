# Learn Python

This repository is designed as a personal learning playground for improving Python programming skills. It contains exercises, mini-projects, notes, and references that help explore Python's core concepts and libraries in a structured way.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a hands-on understanding of Python through practical coding examples. Each directory focuses on a specific topic and grows in complexity as the project progresses.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jjaspreetsingh/learn-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd learn-python
   ```

3. Run scripts using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 basics/variables.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic command-line knowledge
- A code editor such as VS Code or PyCharm

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Learning Goals

- Understand Python syntax and data structures
- Practice problem-solving with real examples
- Learn file handling, error management, and modules
- Explore Python libraries such as requests, pandas, and matplotlib
